To make improvements to my page I was able to embed my resume into my website so visiters don't need to visit an external link to view my resume, it's just going to be right there on the page and it adds some nice content and structure to the page. I also updated a few styling aspects of the site and included a bunch of icons into the site such as on the navbar at the top and as well as the social media links in my contact me section.
The 3rd party script I added to my site was Google Analytics. The script is added onto the index.html file and it is provided by Google via my unique website tag so it can track my analytics. This addition will be useful for me because it will allow me to see what my audience is and who is viewing and interacting with my website so I can get a better understanding of who those people are and what I can do to improve my website for them.
